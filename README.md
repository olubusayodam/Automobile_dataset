#  Project Name: 
Automobile Data Analysis Using Power BI

----
# Project Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to analyze the "Automobile Dataset" obtained from Kaggle using Power BI. The dataset contains information on various automobile characteristics, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses. The goal is to gain insights into automobile specifications, identify trends, and provide data-driven recommendations.



-----
# Data Sourcing:
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and comprises data from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook. The sources include:

1985 Model Import Car and Truck Specifications, 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook.
Personal Auto Manuals, Insurance Services Office, 160 Water Street, New York, NY 10038.
Insurance Collision Report, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Watergate 600, Washington, DC 20037.

# Data Transformation:
Before conducting the data analysis, the dataset underwent several data transformation steps:

Data Dictionary Creation: A data dictionary was created to understand the meaning of each column and its corresponding data type.

Data Cleaning: The following data cleaning steps were performed:

Datatype Conversion: Appropriate data types were assigned to certain columns like 'price', 'horsepower', 'peak-rpm', 'normalized-losses', 'bore', and 'stroke'.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values represented by '?' in specific columns were replaced with zeros for consistency.
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) Measures: DAX measures were created for numerical columns to perform calculations and aggregations during visualization.

# Findings & Recommendation:
The data analysis using Power BI revealed several insights and findings, which can be summarized as follows:

Automobile Characteristics: The dataset provided a detailed view of automobile specifications, such as engine size, curb weight, dimensions, and fuel type.

Risk Ratings: The 'symboling' column helped identify the risk factor associated with each car based on its price, indicating the potential level of safety or risk.

Normalized Losses: The 'normalized-losses' column gave insights into the average loss payment per insured vehicle year, normalized for different car sizes.

Fuel Efficiency: The 'city-mpg' and 'highway-mpg' columns allowed for comparisons of the miles per gallon for city and highway driving.

Price Analysis: The 'price' column provided information on the prices of different car models.

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Manufacturers can focus on producing cars with higher safety ratings ('symboling') to appeal to safety-conscious customers.
Efforts can be made to improve fuel efficiency, as it plays a crucial role in customers' decision-making process.
Pricing strategies can be refined based on insights from the dataset, considering factors such as engine size, curb weight, and fuel efficiency.
Furthermore, additional visualizations and interactive dashboards can be created in Power BI to explore the data further and extract more valuable insights.

# Conclusion:
The Power BI analysis of the "Automobile Dataset" provided valuable insights into automobile characteristics, risk ratings, normalized losses, and pricing. The project's objective was achieved by leveraging Power BI's visualization capabilities to present the findings effectively. The recommendations derived from the analysis can aid decision-making processes in the automobile industry, potentially leading to improved customer satisfaction and business success.
